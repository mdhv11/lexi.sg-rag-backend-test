The claim petition was filed on the basis that on 19.02.2013, Jagir Singh was travelling to Pathankot on his motor cycle and at that juncture, the offending truck bearing temporary registration No. PB-06-6894 belonging to the appellant No. 2 driven in a rash and negligent manner hit the motor cycle of the deceased as a result of which he sustained multiple injuries, and eventually, succumbed to the same when being taken to the hospital. The claim put forth was sought to be sustained on many a basis which need not be adverted to."

The claim put forth was sought to be sustained on many a basis which need not be adverted to. 2. The insurer, the first respondent herein, opposed the claim on the ground that the vehicle in question was driven in violation of the terms of the insurance policy and further the driver was not having a valid and effective driving license and, therefore, it was not obliged to indemnify the insured. That apart, a stand was taken that the vehicle did not have the permit on the date of the accident. On behalf of the owner of the vehicle and driver, assertions were made that the vehicle was insured with the first respondent as per the insurance policy, that the vehicle was registered and the driver had the requisite driving licence. Additionally, copy of the route permit of the offending truck was brought on record."

The award dated 20.11.2014 passed by the tribunal was challenged in FAO No. 1702 of 2016 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. It was contended in appeal that the appellant No. 2, the owner of the offending vehicle, had deposited the necessary fees along with application on 19.02.2013 for issue of route permit and the same was issued on 27.02.2013. It was further urged that when the owner of the vehicle had already submitted the documents in the transport office for grant of permit along with the requisite fees, the tribunal was in error in holding that the vehicle was being plied without a valid permit. In support of the submissions, reliance was placed upon Ashok Kumar Khemaka v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. and other, 2014 (3) RCR (Civil) 1018, National Insurance Company Limited v. Kamlesh Kaur and others, 2006 (3) RCR (Civil) 634 and Moti Ram v. ICICI Lombard and others, 2015 ACJ 1793."

Referring to Section 66 of the Act and placing reliance on Challa Bharathamma case, the High Court opined that even assuming that the owner had already applied for grant of the permit before the accident, the same would not entitle the owner to ply the vehicle. It is worthy to note that the learned single Judge distinguished the decisions cited before him and, resultantly, confirmed the award of the tribunal."

Sub-section (1) thereof provides that no owner of a motor vehicle shall use or permit the use of the vehicle as a transport vehicle in any public place, whether or not such vehicle is actually carrying any passengers or goods save in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by a Regional or State Transport Authority or any prescribed authority. Various provisos have been appended to the main provision stipulating conditions for use of the vehicle and purpose of carriage of goods vehicle. Sub-section (2) states that the holder of a goods carriage permit may use the vehicle for the drawing of any trailer or semi-trailer not owned by him, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed. It is necessary to mention here that a proviso has been added by Act 54 of 1994 with effect from 14.11.1994 allowing the holder of a permit of any articulated vehicle to use the prime-mover of that articulated vehicle for any other semi-trailer. Section 2(2) defines \"articulated vehicle\" to mean a motor vehicle to which a semi-trailer is attached."

In the case at hand, the findings would show that the appellant No. 2 did not have a permit for the vehicle. There is no dispute that the vehicle initially had a temporary registration and eventually the permanent registration. It is the stand of the appellants that the tribunal and the High Court did not appreciate that the chasis of the vehicle was sent to the body where the body of the truck was fabricated and when the vehicle was driven out of the work shop at which point of time it met with an accident. A contention has been made that the insurance policy was in force at the relevant time and, hence, the insurer is legally obliged to indemnify the insured. A distinction has to be made between \"route permit\" and \"permit\" in the context of Section 149 of the Act. Section 149(2) provides the grounds that can be taken as defence by the insurer. It enables the insurer to defend on the ground that there has been breach of a specific condition of the policy, namely, (i) a condition that excludes the use of the vehicle, -(a) for hire or reward, where the vehicle is, on the date of the contract of insurance, a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward, or (b) for organized racing and speed testing, or (c) for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used, where the vehicle is a transport vehicle, or (d) without side-car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle. That apart, it also entitles the insurer to raise the issue pertaining to a condition that excludes driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or that excludes liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war, civil war, riot or civil commotion. A further defence that can be availed of by the insurer is that the policy is void on the ground that it has been obtained by non-disclosure of the material fact or by representation of act which is false in the material particular."

On a perusal of the written statement filed by the owner and the driver, it is evident that the factum of accident having been caused by the vehicle in question had been denied. That apart, there is also a denial of liability that relates to the manner in which the accident had occurred as alleged in the claim petition. It was the specific assertion of the insurer before the tribunal that the vehicle was running in contravention of the provisions of the Act, for it did not possess a route permit. The tribunal, on the basis of the materials brought on record to the effect that the route permit was issued on 27.02.2013 and the accident occurred on 19.02.2013, returned a finding that the vehicle in question did not have the permit. As stated earlier, the High Court has affirmed the same."

That apart, there is also a denial of liability that relates to the manner in which the accident had occurred as alleged in the claim petition. It was the specific assertion of the insurer before the tribunal that the vehicle was running in contravention of the provisions of the Act, for it did not possess a route permit. The tribunal, on the basis of the materials brought on record to the effect that the route permit was issued on 27.02.2013 and the accident occurred on 19.02.2013, returned a finding that the vehicle in question did not have the permit. As stated earlier, the High Court has affirmed the same. 12. Learned counsel for the appellants would submit that in the obtaining factual matrix, the breach would not exonerate the insurer from satisfying the judgment and an award in terms of Section 149 of the Act. He has drawn inspiration from the decision of a three-Judge Bench in National Insurance Co. Ltd v. Swaran Singh and others, (2004) 3 SCC 297. In the said case, the Court was dealing with the interpretation of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) vis-a-vis the proviso appended to sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 149 of the Act. The issue centrally pertained to the necessity of having a driving licence. After adverting to various provisions, the Court also delved into the fundamental concept of third party right.

In the case at hand, it is clearly demonstrable from the materials brought on record that the vehicle at the time of the accident did not have a permit. The appellants had taken the stand that the vehicle was not involved in the accident. That apart, they had not stated whether the vehicle had temporary permit or any other kind of permit. The exceptions that have been carved out under Section 66 of the Act, needless to emphasise, are to be pleaded and proved. The exceptions cannot be taken aid of in the course of an argument to seek absolution from liability. Use of a vehicle in a public place without a permit is a fundamental statutory infraction. We are disposed to think so in view of the series of exceptions carved out in Section 66. The said situations cannot be equated with absence of licence or a fake licence or a licence for different kind of vehicle, or, for that matter, violation of a condition of carrying more number of passengers. Therefore, the principles laid down in Swaran Singh (supra) and Lakhmi Chand (supra) in that regard would not be applicable to the case at hand. That apart, the insurer had taken the plea that the vehicle in question had no permit. It does not require the wisdom of the \"Tripitaka\", that the existence of a permit of any nature is a matter of documentary evidence. Nothing has been brought on record by the insured to prove that he had a permit of the vehicle. In such a situation, the onus cannot be cast on the insurer. Therefore, the tribunal as well as the High Court had directed the insurer was required to pay the compensation amount to the claimants with interest with the stipulation that the insurer shall be entitled to recover the same from the owner and the driver. The said directions are in consonance with the principles stated in Swaran Singh (supra) and other cases pertaining to pay and recover principle."

    "text": "23. In the case at hand, it is clearly demonstrable from the materials brought on record that the vehicle at the time of the accident did not have a permit. The appellants had taken the stand that the vehicle was not involved in the accident. That apart, they had not stated whether the vehicle had temporary permit or any other kind of permit. The exceptions that have been carved out under Section 66 of the Act, needless to emphasise, are to be pleaded and proved. The exceptions cannot be taken aid of in the course of an argument to seek absolution from liability. Use of a vehicle in a public place without a permit is a fundamental statutory infraction. We are disposed to think so in view of the series of exceptions carved out in Section 66. The said situations cannot be equated with absence of licence or a fake licence or a licence for different kind of vehicle, or, for that matter, violation of a condition of carrying more number of passengers. Therefore, the principles laid down in Swaran Singh (supra) and Lakhmi Chand (supra) in that regard would not be applicable to the case at hand. That apart, the insurer had taken the plea that the vehicle in question had no permit. It does not require the wisdom of the \"Tripitaka\", that the existence of a permit of any nature is a matter of documentary evidence. Nothing has been brought on record by the insured to prove that he had a permit of the vehicle. In such a situation, the onus cannot be cast on the insurer. Therefore, the tribunal as well as the High Court had directed the insurer was required to pay the compensation amount to the claimants with interest with the stipulation that the insurer shall be entitled to recover the same from the owner and the driver. The said directions are in consonance with the principles stated in Swaran Singh (supra) and other cases pertaining to pay and recover principle. 24. In view of the aforesaid analysis, we do not perceive any merit in the appeal and, accordingly, the same stands dismissed without any order as to costs."

Section 2(31) of the Act talks about the permit only and Section 149 of the Act is silent about the route permit.

Brief facts of this case are that on 14.06.1995, Kamal Sharma, along with 54 other pilgrims, left Kurukshetra at about 8.00 AM. They had to go to Haridwar, Ayodhya, Nepal and Jagan Nath Puri etc. They were in the Bus bearing registration No.UP-10B-0939, which was being driven by one Raju Karki, resident of Delhi. It is claimed in the claim petition that the bus was taken for journey after getting permission from Regional Transport Controller, Haridwar as well as from Managing Director, Garhwal Vikas Nigam, Haridwar. On the intervening night of 17/18.06.1995, the bus in question was on its way to Kathmandu via Sonali. At about 2.00 AM, when the said bus, in which the deceased-Kamal Sharma was travelling along with other pilgrims, reached in the area of Chitwan, District Chandi Bhajan, Village Vikas Samiti, Ward No.5, situated in Parevar Bhir near bridge No.2, at the distance of two kilometers from Naraingarh, the driver of the Bus lost control and the bus in question fell in Trishuli Nadi. All the 54 persons died in the accident. No dead body of the any pilgrim could be traced as the said river was about 30 meters deep. On account of death of these persons, several claim petitions were filed, one of them was of Sona Devi and others. The present petition was filed by Roop Kumar Sharma on account of death of Kamal Sharma."

R-4, the Tribunal absolved the Insurance Company from making the payment of the compensation on the ground that the policy did not cover the operation of the bus in Nepal. Since the accident occurred in Nepal so the Insurance Company is not liable. 6. While arguing the case, the counsel for the appellant submits that there was no limitation for use of the vehicle in terms of geographical area; as per the policy issued for this vehicle, the schedule of which is also produced on record along with the cover note as Ex R-3."

The next argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that Ex. P-12 is permit of the said bus, which authorised the bus to travel to area of Nepal. It is further submitted that the issue, whether the claim petition can be filed in India; if the accident occurred in Nepal, has already been considered by this Court in FAO No.429 of 1998 decided on 30.11.2010 titled as Sona Devi v. Amil Kumar and others. Counsel for the appellant submits that in that case, the Tribunal held that the claim petition is not maintainable in India, if the accident had taken place out of India. However, this Court remanded the matter to the Tribunal for the decision of the same, on merits, after holding that claim petition can be filed in India."

Therefore, the Insurance Company cannot avoid its liability to pay the compensation only on the ground that the vehicle was used in any particular city, state or a particular geographical area. Once a vehicle is insured qua third party it is insured for all geographical areas as per the provisions of the Act. Only plea the Insurance Company can take to avoid its liability qua third party can be; that the vehicle was not being plied in a particular geographical area in accordance with the provisions of the Act, if any, prescribed for that purpose. Every extent of liability qua third party is covered by the consolidated amount of premium required to be paid for insurance qua third party only. Therefore to cover liability qua third party in any particular geographical area the insured cannot even be asked to pay any extra premium under the provisions of the Act. So the Insurance Company cannot even avoid its liability qua third party, on the ground that it can charge extra premium to cover any particular geographical area and that the insured has not paid that extra premium to cover that particular geographical area. Once insured, the vehicle is insured to cover all geographical areas; where the vehicle is authorised by the authorities to travel."

One can come across a thought that the Motor Vehicles Act extends only to 'whole of India' as per its section 1, so it does not cover the area outside India. However, this rational also does not exempt the Insurance Company from liability arising from the usage of the vehicle outside the geographical area of the Union of India. This section also implies that the Act would be applicable to all the citizens and subjects of India qua all the Motor Vehicular aspects in India. It does not exclude the liability of one citizen or entity of India qua the other citizen of India even if the same is incurred outside the geographical area of Union of India, particularly, when the liability is arising from the use of vehicle registered and insured in India. The extra-territorial jurisdiction of a sovereign nation state over its citizen and their rights and liabilities is well recognised concept of jurisprudence. The sovereign Nation State has plenary powers to make law regarding its citizens and subjects; irrespective of territorial limits, may be, for enforcement of such law in another country the reciprocity may be required. Extra-territorial jurisdiction of a nation state is, jurisprudentially valid on the basis of the 'causes and effects' qua the territory, citizens, subjects and objects of a nation state. Indian Parliament too has this power to legislate for extraterritorial causes and effects, as clarified by Article 245 of the Constitution of India. Hence the Motor Vehicles Act shall also govern the rights and liabilities of citizens and subjects of India; arising from the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, irrespective of territorial limits."

This intention of the Parliament to give extraterritorial effect to the provisions of this aspect of the Act is further clarified by the provisions; as contained in Sections 139 and 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 139 gives powers to the Government of India to make rules regarding the travelling of the vehicles registered in India to other countries. Section 149 (3) makes the Insurance Company liable to satisfy the decree or award for the accidents occurring outside India, even if the same is passed by a foreign Court, but according to provision of Section 149. If the award of a foreign Court passed as per provisions of Section 149 of the Act is enforceable against an Insurance Company in India, then there is no question of the liability of Insurance Company being excluded in Courts in India on the ground that accident occurred outside India."

It is not even disputed by learned counsel for the respondents that the bus in question had the necessary permission to ply in the area of Nepal. Therefore, its insurance policy would be deemed to be validly permitted to travel in the area of travel of the bus. Hence, for the liability arising from the accident involving the vehicle entitled to ply in Nepal, the insurer of the vehicle would be very much liable to make the payment."

The policy produced on record by the appellant shows that this policy does not have any restriction against plying the vehicle outside India. In the name of limitation as to use, only organised racing, reliability test and speed testing have been excluded; in terms of the Motor Vehicles Act.

A though, the copy of the insurance policy produced on record by the Insurance Company as Ex. R-4 contains a vague writing, which speaks \"Geographical area/zone India\". However, comparison of the policies Exhibits R-3 and R-4 show that the policy numbers on these two policies are different. The policy Ex. R-4 carries different details regarding the premium paid and even regarding the details of the vehicle insured. So, it is obvious that the Insurance Company has tried to place on record the insurance policy not pertaining to the bus in question to avoid its liability. This attempt has been made by the Insurance Company; only for one reason that this policy contains stipulation regarding the 'geographical area/zone' which mentions 'India', whereas the original policy/cover note produced by the appellant does not show any such restriction. Therefore, on the basis of this policy Exhibit R-4, which is not even proved to be the policy of the bus in question, the Insurance Company can not avoid its liability to make the payment of the compensation, awarded on account of accident involving the vehicle in question."

For that purpose, the counsel relies upon the document Ex. R-7, which contains a specimen of the endorsement advised to be included in the policy. However, this document itself is not a legal document to exclude the statutory liability of Insurance Company. This is only a suggestion of the Advisory Committee. This was required to be included in the policy by individual Insurance Company, if at all considered appropriate and desirable by it, while insuring a vehicle.

Five petitions were filed at Bathinda for claiming compensation from the State of Punjab and its employees for the death of Surinder Pal, Mahesh Kumar, Jaswant Singh, Rajesh Kumar and Mohinder Singh and one for damages which had been caused to the Jeep. The Tribunal held that negligence of the Punjab Police driver was not proved and dismissed the claim petitions. However, a sum of Rs.50,000/- was awarded to the claimants under no fault liability. The aforesaid appeals arise out of the dismissal of those claim petitions."

    "text": "2. The brief facts are that on 16th January, 1998 Surinder Pal, Mahesh Kumar, Jaswant Singh, Rajesh Kumar, Jarnail Singh and Mohinder Singh were travelling in Jeep bearing No.PB-03-D-9747 and met with an accident with a Punjab Police bus bearing No.PB-13-A-8590 and died. Five petitions were filed at Bathinda for claiming compensation from the State of Punjab and its employees for the death of Surinder Pal, Mahesh Kumar, Jaswant Singh, Rajesh Kumar and Mohinder Singh and one for damages which had been caused to the Jeep. The Tribunal held that negligence of the Punjab Police driver was not proved and dismissed the claim petitions. However, a sum of Rs.50,000/- was awarded to the claimants under no fault liability. The aforesaid appeals arise out of the dismissal of those claim petitions. 3. Petition for compensation for the death of Jarnail Singh was filed before the Tribunal at Sangrur. Before, the Tribunal at Sangrur, the award of Bathinda Tribunal was also placed on record. However, Tribunal at Sangrur held that there was contributory negligence of both the drivers. Against that award, the Insurance Company i.e. United India Insurance Company filed FAO No.5393 of 2002 and a Division Bench of this Court dismissed that appeal by order dated 20.02.2003. That order has become final. It is noteworthy that the State of Punjab or the Punjab police did not file any appeal against the finding of the Sangrur Tribunal holding the Punjab police driver guilty of contributory negligence. Against the compensation amount awarded, LRs of Jarnail Singh filed FAO No.4453 of 2003 (which is being decided by a separate order)."

There is one more supervening factor which needs to be addressed here in the claim petitions out of which FAO No.3562 of 1999 and FAO No.3563 of 1999 have arisen. The claimants did not implead the driver and owner of the jeep (supra). Learned counsel for the appellants have argued that it would be appropriate for this Court to implead the Insurance Company of the Jeep i.e. United India Insurance Company Limited and the owner in view of the fact that the finding on negligence has already been returned. Mr. Rohit Goswami, Advocate for Mr. D.P.Gupta, Advocate for United India Insurance Company Limited has, however, argued that once the Insurance Company and the owner were not parties before the Tribunal it would not be legal to implead them. The owner of the jeep has himself filed FAO No.3563 of 1999 for seeking claim for damages caused to his jeep (which is being decided separately). Since that appeal has been filed through Shri Ashok Jindal, Advocate who also filed FAO No.3562 of 1999, he is in no position to either oppose or support this prayer."

In my opinion even though the argument of Mr. Rohit Goswami, Advocate can not be brushed aside lightly yet it would lead to a very anomalous situation. These appeals have arisen out of an accident where five people have died. In one case where the owner of the jeep and its insurer were parties there is already a final and binding judgment upholding the order that the driver of the jeep was also guilty of contributory negligence and the Insurance Company is bound to compensate the claimants who were passengers in that jeep as per its share. In these circumstances it would be extremely unfair to insist on formal rules of impleadment, especially while effectuating a beneficial legislation. The Insurance company in question i.e. United India Insurance Company Limited is 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and it would not lie in its mouth to take a plea that it can not be impleaded in an accident case where it has been already found liable to pay compensation to the identically situated LRs of another victim of the same accident. Consequently the argument of Mr.Rohit Goswami, Advocate is rejected."

In these circumstances I deem it appropriate to implead the owner-Raj Kumar through counsel Shri Ashok Jindal, Advocate as respondent No.4 in all the appeals except FAO No.3562 of 1999 in which he is impleaded as respondent No.7 and United India Insurance Company Limited through counsel Mr.Rohit Goswami, Advocate as respondents No.5 in all the appeals except FAO No.3562 of 1999 in which it is impleaded as respondent No.8. Registry is directed to make necessary corrections in the memo of parties."

In my opinion, this argument would not suffice; once it is shown that the finding of the Sangrur Tribunal holding that the driver of the Punjab police was guilty of contributory negligence was not challenged by the State, it can not now turn around and claim that there was no negligence on the part of their driver. Nothing stopped the State to file an appeal and thus it cannot now take a U-turn in the present cases and claim that the driver of the State was not guilty of any negligence. In the circumstances, the finding of the Tribunal at Bathinda is set aside and the finding of the Sangrur Tribunal as upheld by the Division Bench to the extent that both the drivers were guilty of contributory negligence would be made applicable to the present cases also."

I, however, find that the Tribunal at Bathinda did not give any finding on the issue of compensation. From the record, it also transpires that these are all burnt cases where the evidence has also been burnt. Learned counsel for the appellants state that they have copies of the entire evidence and pray that the matter be remitted back to the Tribunal at Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bathinda with permission to the claimants to reconstruct the record so that the Tribunal can compute the compensation in view of the finding of contributory negligence. I find it to be a fair submission and allow the appeals in the above terms. Parties through their counsel are directed to appear before Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Bathinda on 18.07.2016. The Tribunal will grant one effective opportunity to each of the parties to reconstruct the record and thereafter compute the compensation which has to be awarded."

Before I part with this judgment there is one other issue which needs to be addressed. 18 long years (almost 2 decades) have passed since the death of the person/s for which the claimants have been clamoring for compensation. There are widows, minor children, old mothers and sisters. It is horrible to imagine how they must have passed this long time. Were they forced into beggary, or worse? Did the minors managed to get any education? Could the girls be married? Is what this Court now doing a travesty of justice?"

Did the minors managed to get any education? Could the girls be married? Is what this Court now doing a travesty of justice? 12. In these stark circumstances I deem it appropriate to grant some interim compensation to the claimants. In FAO No.94 of 2000, the appellants-claimants are widow and two minor daughters of Rajesh Kumar. The respondents No.1 and 6 are directed to deposit Rs.3.00 lacs with the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bathinda on or before the date fixed there for immediate disbursal in equal shares to the three appellants while in FAO No.2407 of 2000 the claimants are mother, father, and two sisters of the same Rajesh Kumar. In this case I deem it appropriate to direct the respondents No.1 and 6 to deposit Rs.1 lakh as interim compensation on or before the date fixed there for immediate disbursal to the three appellants. Out of this amount of Rs.1 lakh, Rs.50,000/- be paid to appellant No.1-mother and Rs.25,000/- each to the appellants No.3 and 4 (unmarried sisters). In FAO No.3562 of 1999, I direct the respondents No.1 and 6 to deposit Rs.3 lakhs on or before the date fixed for immediate disbursal to the appellants No.1, 2 and 3 i.e. widow and children in equal shares on or before the date fixed for immediate disbursal to them. In FAO No.160 of 2001, I direct respondents No.3 and 5 to deposit a sum of Rs.3.5 lakhs on or before the date fixed for disbursal to the appellants No.1 to 5. Out of this amount Rs.1 lakh be given to appellant No.1, widow of the deceased Mahesh Kumar, Rs.50,000/- each to appellants No.2, 3 and 5 being the minor sons and mother of the deceased and Rs.1 lakh to appellant No.4, minor daughter of the deceased."

FAO No.3561 of 1999 has been filed by the widow, two minor sons, one minor daughter, mother and father of deceased-Jaswant Singh, driver of Jeep No. PB-03-D-9747 and FAO No.3563 of 1999 has been filed by the owner of the said jeep. Since the driver of the jeep has also been held guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 50% the compensation amount payable to these legal representatives and the owner of the jeep for damages having been caused to it would have to be halved and that half amount would be payable by the respondents including the State of Punjab. Therefore, I direct respondent No.3-State of Punjab to deposit Rs.3.5 lakhs on or before the date fixed for immediate disbursal to appellants No.1 to 5 (Rs.1 lakh to appellants No.1 and 4 each, Rs.50,000/- to appellants No.2, 3 and 5, sons and mother)."

It is made clear that these amounts will be liable to be set off against the compensation finally computed by the Tribunal. It is further made clear that these amounts are just a rough and ready reckoning of interim relief because of the stark circumstances of the present cases and the Tribunal would decide the issue of compensation and apportionment independently. 15. Since the main case has been decided, the Civil Misc. Application, if any, also stands disposed of. ."

The appellant is a labourer who met with an accident on 18.04.1999 while he was travelling by tractor and trolley bearing No.MH-24-A-6176 and MH-24-A-0218 respectively on Latur - Nanded road from Chikalana village, when a truck bearing No.MH-12-6454 came from behind and rammed into the tractor and trolley in which the appellant was travelling. As a result, the accident occurred and the appellant sustained multiple injuries and he was admitted to Civil Hospital, Latur for medical treatment. The appellant filed the case of compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal claiming compensation of L 3 lakhs. The Evidence was led by both the parties. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal on analysing the evidence before it came to the conclusion that the accident took place because of the rash and negligent driving by the driver of the truck as a result of which the appellant had sustained various injuries. The Tribunal also arrived at the conclusion that the income of the appellant was L 21,600/- per annum and by applying multiplier of 18 for loss of income, arrived at a figure of L 2,33,200/- and 60% thereof as the compensation on the ground that disability was 60% and not 100%. In this manner a sum of L 1,72,800/- with interest of 9% from the date of the petition till realization of the amount in full was awarded to the appellant. After addition of the interest, total sum of L 2,33,200/- was awarded by the Tribunal."

Not satisfied with the aforesaid amount of compensation, the appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court. The High Court accepted the finding of the Trial Court that the annual income of the appellant was L 21,600/-, multiplier of 18 was applicable and disability was 60%. Thus award for loss of income in the sum of L 1,72,800/- is maintained. The High Court, however, found that while awarding the amount, no amount towards pains and suffering is awarded nor any amount is awarded towards loss of future prospects and medical expenses. Accordingly, the High Court has awarded a sum of L 20,000/- by way of medical expenses and L 50,000/- towards pains and sufferings and with the addition of further sum of L 50,000/- towards loss of amenities. In the manner, total compensation to the appellant is worked out at L 3,53,200/- with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of petition till realization."

Being dissatisfied, the appellant has filed the instant appeal. The counsel for the appellant submitted that though the appellant had suffered 60% disability resulting into loss of right hand, no amount towards loss of future prospects has been awarded by the courts below. Learned counsel for the appellant is right in his submission. Once we find that there was a permanent disability to the extent of 60% and there is a loss of right hand of the appellant, it is definitely going to affect future prospects of the appellant."

We are of the opinion that the ends of justice would be sub-served by giving a consolidated sum of L 1,50,000/- towards loss of future prospects. We are conscious of the fact that the appellant in his petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal was given only an amount of L 3 lakhs. However, in a case like this where the compensation is to be given to the appellant for suffering the accident due to the fault of the driver of the truck and which has resulted in permanent disability to the extent of 60%, we are of the opinion that whatever amount that is legitimately due to the appellant in law should be paid to him and this Court can exercise such power by granting more amount than what he claimed once that amount is found to be due and legitimately payable to the appellant under Article 132 of the Constitution. This was the course of action which was followed by this Court in Jitendra Khimshankar Trivedi & Ors. v. Kasam Daud Kumbhar & Ors. reported in 2015(1) R.C.R. (Civil) 828 : 2015(1) Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 465 : 2015 (4) SCC 237."

I have heard learned counsel for the parties, appraised the paper book, impugned award and the annexures attached thereto and of the view that there is no force and merit in the submissions of Mr. Longia. 7. The conceded position on record as per the averments is that the aforementioned meter was checked in the laboratory on 13.03.2015 (Annexure P-5) but the said report reveals that inspection was done in the absence of the consumer. 8. It is settled law that inspection of the meter has to be done in the laboratory in the presence of the consumer. Having failed to do so, the alleged demand of arrears on the basis of checking by overhauling the account is fatal to the claim of the Board. 9. There is another aspect of the matter.

Section 56 stipulates that if there is an endorsement on a negotiable instrument that a part of the sum mentioned in the cheque has been paid, then the instrument may be negotiated for the balance. Section 56 reads as follows: “56. Indorsement for part of sum due.- No writing on a negotiable instrument is valid for the purpose of negotiation if such writing purports to transfer only a part of the amount appearing to be due on the instrument; but where such amount has been partly paid a note to that effect may be indorsed on the instrument, which may then be negotiated for the balance.” 19 27.

The appellant claims that severe prejudice would be caused to him if the delay is not condoned for he would be left defenceless in the civil suit. He accordingly seeks that this Court invoke its inherent discretion under Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC and grant one final opportunity to file his written statement. 10.

ANALYSIS & CONCLUSION 11. At the outset, it must be noted that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 through Section 16 has amended the CPC in its application to commercial disputes to provide as follows: Page | 5 “16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.—(1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the"

Kartar Singh, 1987 P.L.J. 95 to contend that the notification declaring the property as vesting in the Wakf Board is not conclusive regarding the rights of third person. For returning such findings, reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Board of Muslim Wakf, Rajasthan v. Radha Kishan and others, AIR 1979 Supreme Court 289 and earlier judgment of this Court reported as Punjab Wakf Board v. Commissioner, Patiala Division and others, 1973 Revenue Law Reporter 467."

Considering  the  fact  that  the cheque was issued in the year 1999 and having regard to the other facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice we deem it appropriate to modify the sentence of imprisonment  imposed  upon  the  appellant  and  also  the  fine amount of Rs.4,17,148/-"
